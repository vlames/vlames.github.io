Today I looked at the projects that people from previous terms worked on and got interested in doing a weather app. I searched the web and found a free react icons that I might use for my app. Since I am still rusty with React, I looked at some guides so that I could understand the core basics of react better. I did a different tutorial than what was required for assignment 5 and it indeed gave me a better understanding of react. The tutorial app worked well for me. Even though I already looked at some weather APIs, I still need to choose a suitable one.

Looks like OpenWeatherMap would be more suitable for my project since it allows 60 calls for data per minute unlike other APIs. I signed up for a free service with OpenWeatherMap, reviewed available APIs and tried to start a test app. I got an error which I will try to handle later.

Today I will try to set up my app manually and resolve an issue obtained last time. By the end of today I realized that setting up the application manually will take the unncessesary time and ended up using the create-react-app, the npx command. Now I have react render a form that will be used to submit information that will be used to get information from the api. I was also able to test api call and obtained information. But, I get a different error than before that might have to do with how I store information. I will invistegate that later on.

Today I did the major work in designing the looks of my app. I was able to remove the error I was getting before, acquired and resolved additonal errors that had to do with the fact that a class component in react can return one parent element, and some parsing of data. I was able to make my app display the correct temperature values in Farenheight and the image associated with he weather. Tomorrow, I will need to work on functionality to add and remove weather locations to compare.

For the most of the day, I was battling to understand how prop and state passing is done in react forms. I was only able to comprehend how to change a value in the state, but the next goal would be adding an item to the state array.

Today I was able to code most of the functionality. I struggled with getting the Form state store the necessary data the first time the button is pressed. It would keep storing empty strings and after reading an article online I was able to fix it with "async" and "await". I got to the point of storing tags to render on button click, but get an error trying to render. I will follow up on that the next day.

Today my goal is to fix the rendering issue, properly comment the code and see into some additional features and deployement. At this point I was able to fix the rendering error. Weather cards can now be added and displayed, but also, they now can be removed. For some time I could not understand why the api does not send me the city data for the specific state I instructed it to. It turned out that it needed state abbreviations, and not the full state name. One react library helped me to convert state names to state abbreviations. Finally I commented the code so that it could be evaluated more easily. I will now appload the code with all the modifications and formatting. Then, I will edit gitHub README and conclude with that. I might try to deploy the app and if succeed will point to it.
