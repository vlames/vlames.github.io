              This was one of the first, outside of class projects. One day a person
              spoke to me. He recently arrived to US and was studying to become a
              truck driver. He wanted to use an existing quiz software, add
              questions to it and study. At that time I was at the beginning of my
              programming education and figured it would be nearly impossible for me
              to add questions to and existing software if I don't know how to code
              on that level. I decided to create my own, simple application, which
              turned out to be complex, but I enjoyed the thrill of developing it.

              I worked on the project many years ago. At that time I worked on the
              quiz creator terminal application. I thought of descovering how the
              pretty apple icons are made. I did a research and found steps to
              follow and do just that. The most difficult part was to design the
              icon itself. I used some graphical application (could have been
              photoshop) to assemble different pre-made parts and add my touch.
              Because the application was called the Quiz Creator, I thought it
              would be a good idea to unite a few concepts involved in it: questions
              that make up a quiz and building.

              SubOps is one of my recent projects. I wanted to learn how to wrie
              subtitles and help out with translating spiritually important videos
              to my native language. Writing subtitles is not a so easy task as one
              might think. Besides content, it involves timing for each sibtitle
              line. I ended up using the Audacity software to view audio waves in a
              particular video. The problem was that the program has so called
              labels which do give start and end time but formatted differently.
              Because of that I wrote one of the features that would convert label
              time format to SRT.

              Once upon a time, at one Seventh-Day-Adventist Church, I was tasked
              to manage a mutual fund. One of the duties was to write out receipts
              to a person who was enrolling or contributing to the fund. At that time,
              the fund consisted of many people and writing out receipts by hand would
              take lots of time. At one point I decided to try to write a simple program
              that would both, give me more practice in writing computer programs and
              help me save some time preparing receipts. I found a pdf library for the
              Rust programming language, studied it, and with strength and wisdom from
              the Holy Spirit, was able to accomplish my goal.

              In the Full Stack Web Development course, as a student, I needed
              to write a web application that would make an API call to some
              server, receive data, and display it on the screen. I decided to
              do a weather application. I called it WeatComp. It stands for
              weather compare. Before a user would plan a short trip to nearby
              cities, it would be a good idea to know what the weather is like
              and prioritize activities accordingly. In my development journey
              I studied and applied React for the frontend. Again, with enormous
              help of the Holy Spirit, the task was accomplished.

              This project was done for the Web, Cloud, and Security course.
              As the course was nearing its end, I was inspired to do a particular
              application. Because faith comes from hearing and hearing comes from
              the Word of God, christian life involves reading the Word of God, The Bible. 
              Memorizing verses also helps to fortify faith. Thus I decided to follow
              the inspiration and at the end came up with a simple application
              that would help one memorize verses. Out of all my projects, this
              one involves the most languages.

              Portland intro was a project developed for the Frontend Web
              Technologies course. For the first time I was able to cooperate
              very closely with a classmate on a course project. We learned
              a lot about Git and the importance of meetings. The project
              idea was to introduce a person to Portland and its surroundings.
              It involved various API calls, a framework, and a backend to
              achieve API keys hiding and solve CORS issues. As always, I
              am thankful to my God for wisdom and help.

              The riscv continuous integration project was a Cap Stone project.
              It involved a team of 8 people who worked together to automate
              the process of testing a picolibc library for riscv instruction set
              used in embedded devices. My contribution was a Docker file
              that helped us build a portable environment to run the tests in.
              This was my first serious dive into a containerized solution and I
              was glad my God helped me contribute to the project.
