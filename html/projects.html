          I worked on the project many years ago. At that time I worked on the
          quiz creator terminal application. I thought of descovering how the
          pretty apple icons are made. I did a research and found steps to
          follow and do just that. The most difficult part was to design the
          icon itself. I used some graphical application (could have been
          photoshop) to assemble different pre-made parts and add my touch.
          Because the application was called the Quiz Creator, I thought it
          would be a good idea to unite a few concepts involved in it: questions
          that make up a quiz and building.

          This was one of the first, outside of class projects. One day a person
          spoke to me. He recently arrived to US and was studying to become a
          truck driver. He wanted to use an existing quiz software, add
          questions to it and study. At that time I was at the beginning of my
          programming education and figured it would be nearly impossible for me
          to add questions to and existing software if I don't know how to code
          on that level. I decided to create my own, simple application, which
          turned out to be complex, but I enjoyed the thrill of developing it.

          SubOps is one of my recent projects. I wanted to learn how to wrie
          subtitles and help out with translating spiritually important videos
          to my native language. Writing subtitles is not a so easy task as one
          might think. Besides content, it involves timing for each sibtitle
          line. I ended up using the Audacity software to view audio waves in a
          particular video. The problem was that the program has so called
          labels which do give start and end time but formatted differently.
          Because of that I wrote one of the features that would convert label
          time format to SRT.
