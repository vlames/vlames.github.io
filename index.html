      <h3>My Life</h3>
      <p>
        I was born in Bryansk, Russia. I have brothers and sisters who live in
        different parts of the world. Due to the type of job my dad had, our
        family moved frequently. We lived in Bryansk, Kaluga, Novaya Usman, and
        Voronezh. In my home country, I completed 7 grades of general education
        and 5 years of music education. In music school I learned how to play
        piano. At the end of 2005, my family moved to United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the time of my arival to US, I was 15. I knew only a few words in
        English and was not able to communicate. ESL program in Milwaukie and
        David Douglas High Schools helped me learn basics of English and move on
        to higher education. Originally, I thought of studing to become an
        Ophthalmologist, an eye doctor, but at one point decided to explore
        programming. Here, in US, I attended a concert in which one of the
        people played an instrument called pan flute. I was able to purchase it
        in Hawaii and grasp the basics of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I learn new programing languages and aquire important skills to
        become a better engineer. I continue to play piano and a pan flute in
        church. I am a member of international choir group, Oregon Adventist
        Men's Choir. We hold concerts in Oregon, Washington, and other countries
        and strive to bring a positive change in society.
